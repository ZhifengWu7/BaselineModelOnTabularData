Code Overview
Data Generation
The code generates a tabular dataset with n_samples matrices, each of size n x m. Gaussian noise is added to these matrices using the noisy_channels function.

Models
Two neural network models are defined:

LinearRegressionModel: A simple linear regression model.
MLPModel: A Multi-Layer Perceptron with a residual connection and optional dropout.
Training and Evaluation
The train_and_evaluate function trains a given model on the noisy data and evaluates its performance based on the validation loss. Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting.

Main Execution
The main script:

Defines training parameters such as batch_size, num_epochs, learning_rate, and patience.
Initializes lists to store MSE values for different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR).
Trains and evaluates both models across a range of SNR values.
Computes baseline MSE.
Plots the MSE results against SNR values.
How to Run
Ensure all required packages are installed.
Run the script using:
bash
复制代码
python your_script.py
The script will output the MSE values for the Linear Regression and MLP models, as well as the baseline MSE, and display a plot comparing their performance.
Function Descriptions
noisy_channels(x, logsnr)
Adds Gaussian noise to the input tensor x based on the given log SNR value.

Parameters:
x: Input tensor.
logsnr: Log Signal-to-Noise Ratio.
Returns: Noisy tensor z and the noise epsilon.
LinearRegressionModel
A simple linear regression model implemented using PyTorch.

Parameters:
in_dim: Input dimension.
out_dim: Output dimension.
MLPModel
A Multi-Layer Perceptron with a residual connection and optional dropout.

Parameters:
in_dim: Input dimension.
out_dim: Output dimension.
dropout: Dropout rate.
train_and_evaluate(x, logsnr, model, batch_size, num_epochs, learning_rate, patience)
Trains the given model on the noisy data and evaluates its validation loss.

Parameters:
x: Input data tensor.
logsnr: Log Signal-to-Noise Ratio.
model: Neural network model to train.
batch_size: Batch size for training.
num_epochs: Number of epochs for training.
learning_rate: Learning rate for the optimizer.
patience: Number of epochs to wait for early stopping.
Returns: Best validation loss achieved.
Results
The results are visualized in a plot that shows the MSE of the Linear Regression model, MLP model, and the baseline MSE against the log SNR values. The plot also includes the MMSE for comparison.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of Linear Regression and MLP models on noisy tabular data. It provides insights into the models' performance across different noise levels.
